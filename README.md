# Sentiment Analysis of Union Budget 2019

Social media has become an effective tool in any organisation’s public reception. People are more
engaged in the social life media nowadays thanks to availability of internet data. Online social media
analytics is a powerful tool to boost e-commerce, politics etc. In marketing field companies use it to
develop their strategies, to understand customers’ feelings towards products or brand, how people
respond to their campaigns or product launches and why consumers don’t buy some products.
Sentiment analysis also is used to monitor and analyse social phenomena, for the spotting of
potentially dangerous situations and determining the general mood of the blogosphere. In political
field, it is used to keep track of political view, to detect consistency and inconsistency between
statements and actions at the government level. It can be used to predict election results as well! In
this project we have a dataset of Union Budget 2019 of India that consists of tweets of public about
